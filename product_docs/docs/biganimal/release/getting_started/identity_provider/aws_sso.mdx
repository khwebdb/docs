## Prerequisites

- To connect BigAnimal to Amazon Web Services Signle Sign-On(AWS SSO), your AWS account must have administrator access. 

- A unique URL and access code are provided in an email from cloudcare@enterprisedb.com. Contact [cloudcare@enterprisedb.com](mailto:cloudcare@enterprisedb.com) if you don't receive the email. The URL becomes invalid after you set up your identity provider with BigAnimal. For issues with the code or identity provider setup, contact [Support](/biganimal/release/overview/support).
